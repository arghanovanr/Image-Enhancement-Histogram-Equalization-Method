# Image-Enhancement-Histogram-Equalization-Method
Image Enhancement using Histogram Equalization Method written with JAVA language and OpenCV Libraries <br />

This is College final project, i am developed an image enghancement to  <br />

### here the abstract <br />

Objects Detection such as faces is very useful in the field of security and <br /> 
data collection processes such as surveys. The face detection algorithm requires an <br />
input image that displays the face object clearly and brightly. If the image is too  <br />
dark, it will be difficult for the algorithm to detect the presence of the face. For that  <br />
we need a method that is used to clarify facial objects in dark images. Histogram  <br />
Equalization is a method used to even out the brightness intensity value of an image.  <br />
This method is suitable for use because the intensity of the brightness of dark images  <br />
tends to be closer to the left so that the distribution needs to be evened out. The  <br />
research was conducted by developing software that can improve the quality of  <br />
dark images using the Histogram Equalization method. The results of this study  <br />
indicate the success of the software in helping face detection algorithms in dark  <br />
images. The average level of accuracy of the Intersection Over Union obtained is  <br />
0.783, which means that it is quite accurate in the process of detecting objects in  <br />
the form of faces. <br />
